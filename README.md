So In 3rd semester i have python as a practical language where there i 
learn it and now my 3rd semester exam are just started i thing to have 
a project with python that i learn so i decided to do project on location 
tracking of a phone number by just entering the number and this is just 
basic start of my idea that i think but i just have a view to work more
on this idea and make more improved version it self and it can be able 
to track and phone number location by just means of a click so i am still
working on it and i will update how i do it.
